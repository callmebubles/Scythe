# Scythe
A  web scraper that deposits names scraped into a CSV file with possible username/emails combinations based on those names. Only works on sites with a first and last name listed as most emails are a combination of both names. The email combinations use the domain and suffix pulled from the url given as an argument. Created by Waylon Stoltey and Sarah Rangel for our capstone project for Fullstack Academy.
